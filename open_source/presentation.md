# Who am I, why am I qualified to give this talk and what is this talk about?

- 10+ years experience in software development and 5 years in DevOps
<!-- pause -->
- I'm a tinkerer and love to learn new things
<!-- pause -->
- I've contributed two small PR's to a popular and large open source project
<!-- pause -->
- I've followed several open source projects and have a good understanding of
  how they work as a community and some of the ups and downs they experience.
<!-- pause -->

Simple answer is, I'm not an expert in open source but I have some experience
and I'm passionate about it. I want to share my experience and knowledge with
you.

<!-- pause -->

This talk is about why open source is important, how you can get involved and
what the benefits and downsides are based on my experiences.

# What is Open Source and why is it important?

<!-- pause -->

Open Source software is software that is free to use, modify, and distribute
under the terms of the license that the writers chose to release it under.
<!-- pause -->
Open source software is usually developed by a community of people who are
passionate about the project and want to make it better.
<!-- pause -->
Open source software is important because it allows people to learn from the
code, to contribute to the project and to make tools you use every day better.
<!-- pause -->
Open source code permeates the software industry and is used in almost every
project you can think of.
<!-- pause -->
There are several types of projects created by a variety of open source
communities, including:
- Operating systems
- Programming language compilers, interpreters and ecosystems
- Web servers
- Databases
- Libraries and frameworks
- Tools and utilities

<!-- end_slide -->

# History of Open Source?

- At the advent of computing and software, software was largely created by the
  academic community who generally shared the source code freely.
<!-- pause -->
- As time progressed and software became more complex, companies started to
  charge for software and the source code was no longer available.
<!-- pause -->
- In the 1980's Richard Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and
  created the GNU project which aimed to create a free operating system.
<!-- pause -->
- In the 1990's Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel and released it under
  the GPL licence which was a huge success and is now one of the most popular
  operating systems in the world.
<!-- pause -->
- In the 2000's Git was created and later GitHub and similar hosting platforms
  which made it easy for people to contribute to open source projects and for
  maintainers to manage their projects.

# Fun of licences and code of conduct

There are several options for open source licences and they all have their own
intricacies. Common examples are Apache, MIT and GPL.
<!-- pause -->

Code of conduct is a set of rules that the community agrees to follow. It is
important to have a code of conduct to ensure that the community is a safe and
welcoming place for everyone.
<!-- pause -->

Rights you have as a permanent employee to contribute to open source projects:
- It usually depends on the licence that the project is under and whether your
  company is competing.
<!-- pause -->
- Generally speaking they're is unlikely to mind if you contribute to anything
  that is not a direct competitor to their business.
<!-- pause -->
- If in doubt check with BJSS.
<!-- end_slide -->

# What are the benefits and downsides of open source?

# How can you get involved in open source?

There are several ways to get involved in open source projects, but this is a
common way to start:

- First find a project that you are passionate about.
- Read the contributing guidelines and code of conduct.
- Look for issues that are tagged as `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
- Fork the project and clone it to your local machine.
- Create a new branch and make your changes.
- Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request.
- Wait for feedback and make any changes that are requested.
- Profit...

<!-- end_slide -->

# How can you be successful in open source projects?

My advice for being successful in open source projects is to:
- Be respectful and follow the code of conduct.
- Be patient and understanding.
- Be open to feedback and willing to learn.
- Ask questions, but do your own research first.
- Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

<!-- pause -->

Biggest thing I learned though, don't assume open source projects are the
results of geniuses doing amazing things, it's actually a lot more about hard
work and dedication of many people.

<!-- end_slide -->

# What can I contribute?

People might think it's all about code but there are many ways to contribute to
open source:
- Documentation
- Testing
- Bug fixes
- Feature requests
- Code reviews
- Mentoring
- Community management
- Marketing
- Management
- Design
- User experience
- Reporting bugs
- Many more...

As you can see, you don't have to be a programmer to contribute to open source.

<!-- pause -->

You can also try and build your own projects and communities around ideas you
have. This is more difficult and most don't manage this but some do.

<!-- end_slide -->

# What was my experience?

My first open source contribution was actually during the Rare project where I
had to make changes to an open source project to get it to work with their use
case: https://github.com/Azure/AzureConnectedMachineDsc

<!-- pause -->

I have contributed two small PR's to the Rust compiler and it was a great
experience and I learned a lot.

<!-- pause -->

I found the community to be very welcoming and helpful, I can't promise they're
all like that but I think most are.

<!-- pause -->

Before actually making contributions I spent a lot of time reading and
understanding the code and it was a great way to learn the language really well.

<!-- pause -->

I originally created an issue here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/112857
One of the Rust community suggested a fix and I built upon it from there by
building tests and basically doing TDD.

<!-- pause -->

I then found another issue that looked interesting and I worked on that too:
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121595

# What is Vim/Neovim?

- Explain that Vim is a modal editor, what that means and why it's good
  - No mouse
  - No menus
  - No distractions
  - No need to take your hands off the keyboard
  -
- Open vim first as plain Vim, maybe show a quick demo of Macros as something cool
- Downside of course, you need to learn all the keybindings
- Good news, you can configure it to your heart's content

# What are the differences between Vim and Neovim?

- Neovim is not as stable as Vim, it has a lot of features that are still in development and can break at any time.
  This means that if you're using Neovim, you need to be prepared for things to break occasionally, not super often and
seldom intrusively.
- Vim is very simple, a very powerful text editor but it's very difficult to make it do some of the things we might like
  from an IDE
    - LSPs
    - Linters
    - Treesitter
    - Debugging
    - Git integration
    - Agentic Coding
    - etc
- Vim is very extensible, but Neovim is even more so, Neovim we can configure with Lua and it has a lot more options
than Vim does as a result. Vim we need to learn Vimscript which is a bit of a pain.
